# E-Wallet
The e-wallet project consists of user registration, initial wallet creation with a 100 INR bonus, and a transaction system.  Users can then initiate transactions, which lead to the sender's wallet being debited and the recipient's wallet being credited, followed by email notifications to both parties.
